Smart Traffic Management System for Urban Traffic Control using Machine Learning
Overview
Our Smart Traffic Management System uses Machine Learning to intelligently control traffic signals, ensuring that vehicles spend the least time waiting. The system uses AI to analyze real-time traffic data from CCTV cameras and adjusts the signal timings dynamically, providing a smooth flow of traffic throughout urban areas.

Problem Statement
Traffic Congestion: The increasing number of vehicles in urban areas has led to severe congestion at intersections.
Inefficient Signal Timing: Fixed signal timings waste time when traffic density is low, causing delays and fuel wastage.
Multiple Signal Stops: Drivers often stop at each consecutive signal, causing delays and inefficiency.

Traditional Solutions
Manual Control:
Requires significant manpower, as traffic police need to manage each signal.
Automatic Timer-Based Control:
Signals change at fixed intervals, regardless of the traffic situation, leading to inefficiency during low traffic periods.
Electronic Control with Sensors:
Uses sensors to detect traffic but requires expensive installation and often faces issues with accuracy and coverage.

Drawbacks of Traditional Solutions
Manual Control: Involves human intervention, making it prone to errors and inefficiencies.
Timer-Based Control: Doesnâ€™t account for real-time traffic density, causing unnecessary delays.
Sensors: Expensive and often have limited accuracy in varying traffic conditions.

Proposed Smart Traffic System
Our Smart Traffic Management System uses Machine Learning to automatically adjust traffic signal timings based on real-time traffic density detected via CCTV cameras. The system calculates the optimal signal time for each direction and minimizes congestion by ensuring that each lane gets the appropriate amount of green signal time according to the traffic load.

Key Features:
AI-Based Traffic Control: Uses AI to analyze real-time data and determine optimal green light duration.
Dynamic Signal Timing: Signals are adjusted dynamically based on real-time traffic conditions.
No New Hardware Required: The system works with existing CCTV infrastructure, saving on installation costs.

How the System Works
Capture Vehicle Images: CCTV cameras capture real-time images of traffic at each signal.
Traffic Detection: The system uses image recognition to count the number of vehicles in each lane.
AI Traffic Analysis: The AI analyzes the data and determines how much green time each lane requires.
Dynamic Signal Adjustment: The traffic signal timings are updated dynamically based on the AI's decision.

Advantages of Our Smart Traffic Management System
Autonomous: No need for manual control or traffic police.
Efficient: Signal timings are dynamically adjusted based on traffic density.
Cost-Effective: No need to install additional sensors or hardware.
Improved Traffic Flow: Reduces waiting times, increasing vehicle throughput at intersections.

Step-by-Step Flowchart of the System
Capture Vehicle Image: CCTV cameras capture images of vehicles at traffic signals.
Vehicle Detection and Counting: The system counts the number of vehicles in each lane.
AI Traffic Density Calculation: The vehicle count data is sent to the AI for traffic analysis.
AI Signal Timing Calculation: The AI decides the optimal green signal time based on traffic density.
Traffic Signal Update: The signal timing is updated to reflect the calculated green time for each lane.

Factors Considered by AI for Traffic Signal Control
Image Processing Time: Time taken by the system to process images and calculate traffic density.
Vehicle Startup Lag: Delay each vehicle experiences when starting from a stop.
Vehicle Speed: Average speed of different vehicle categories.
Lane Count: Number of lanes at the intersection.

Visualization of Traffic Flow
Static Model Visualization
In the static model, each signal is given a fixed time (e.g., 30 seconds), regardless of the traffic density. This results in wasted time when there are fewer vehicles in a lane.

Dynamic Model Visualization
In the dynamic model, the system calculates traffic density and adjusts the green signal time accordingly. This results in reduced waiting times and better vehicle throughput.

Performance Improvement
Our dynamic system was able to pass 837 more vehicles than the static system in 1 hour (a 35% increase).

On average, the dynamic system allows 70 more vehicles to pass per 5-minute simulation, reducing unnecessary waiting times and signal inefficiency.

NEAT AI Model
How NEAT AI Works

The NEAT AI (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) model is trained to dynamically adjust signal timings based on traffic data. It learns from simulations to optimize traffic flow.

Graphical Visualization of AI Coordination
This demonstrates how the AI coordinates the signals to prevent unnecessary stops for vehicles traveling on the same route.

Conclusion
The dynamic system significantly reduces vehicle waiting times compared to static systems.

Our AI-powered traffic management system improves overall performance by over 35%.

The AI model can further reduce waiting time for vehicles at subsequent traffic signals, enhancing urban mobility.

This system can be implemented using edge computing at the traffic signal itself, making it cost-effective and easy to deploy with minimal infrastructure changes.
